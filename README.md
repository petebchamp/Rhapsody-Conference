# Rhapsody-Conference

In 2017 I was invited to Orion's annual Rhapsody users conference to present our use of the Rhapsody integration tool within Kaiser Permanente.

We had developed several systems using Rhapsody, HL7 messaging, web services, and SQL to automate population health-related processes, including automatically placing clinically indicated lab and radiology orders, monitoring order status, notifiying patients of overdue tests, and synchronizing PCP panels between the EMR and the custom PCP-linking application.
